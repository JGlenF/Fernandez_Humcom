        <p><i>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i> is the third and final installment in the series of games developed by
        <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/CD_Projekt" Target="_blank" title="CD Projekt RED">CD Projekt RED</a> 
        featuring the witcher <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Geralt_of_Rivia" Target="_blank">Geralt of Rivia</a>
        The game was originally scheduled for release in late 2014, then pushed back to 24 February 2015, and finally
         released on 19 May 2015. During the first two weeks since release it had sold more than 4 million 
         copies worldwide, more than doubling the total sales of its predecessor, <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_2:_Assassins_of_Kings"

        <p>Unlike the previous games, The Witcher 3 is set in a multi-region open world, featuring over 100 hours 
        of content. Several early articles mentioned that the developers planned to have an open world similar 
        to that of Skyrim, but 20% larger. The developers were quick to point out that while there was much to 
        appreciate in Bethesda's open world concept, they were also making an effort not to repeat what they perceived 
        as the flaws in-game. As with earlier games, the consequences of Geralt's actions will impact how the narrative 
        progresses. The game has been built using the new REDengine 3 and was designed with player feedback from fans of
         previous Witcher games in mind.</p>

         <p>On September 4, 2020, it was announced that the game and its expansions would be getting a next-generation
            upgrade and would be released as a standalone purchase for the next-generation consoles (Xbox Series X and
            PlayStation 5) as well as PC. A free update will be given out to those who already own the game on the PC,
            Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. It's expected to be released in 2021.</p>

            <article>
            <p>The world is in chaos. The air is thick with tension and the smoke of burnt villages. The fearsome
            <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Nilfgaardian_Empire" Target="_blacnk">Nilfgaardian Empire</a>
            has struck again, ravaging the helpless <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Northern_Kingdoms"
            target="_blank">Northern Kingdoms</a> The once mighty who tried to use Geralt for their own gain are now gone. In these uncertain times, no one can say what fortune holds in store, who will bring peace to the world and who will cause it only misery. But a force darker and deadlier emerges.
            </p>
            <p>The petty men and women commanding tin-plated armies fail to understand that their conflict is child's play compared to the
                <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Hunt" target="_blank">Wild Hunt</a>
                the otherworldly threat which now looms. These ghastly spectral riders have for ages plagued humankind, bringing misery to the world. This time the Wild Hunt seeks one person in particular: the one individual Destiny itself bestowed upon Geralt, the one soul Geralt considers kin.
