                One of my <font color="red"><i><b></b>favorite</i></b></font> books are the Harry Potter series.
                One of my <font color="red"><i><b></b>favorite</i></b></font> books from the <u>Harry Potter</u> series is the <u>Sorcerer’s Stone</u>, which is the <font color="red"><i><b></b>first</i></b></font> book.
                This book’s <font color="red"><i><b></b>first</i></b></font> edition was released in October of 1998 and was written by <u>J.K. Rowling</u>.
                The book starts off introducing the <font color="red"><i><b></b>wizarding</i></b></font> world from 
                the vantage point of the <u>Dursley’s</u> who we later find out 
                are the Aunt and Uncle of <u>Harry Potter</u>, a boy who’s 
                parents were murdered while he managed to survive. The 
                attack on <u>Harry's</u> parents left a signature lightning bolt scar
                on his forehead.
