                <section >The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i> is the third and final installment in the series of games developed by
                    <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/CD_Projekt" Target="_blank" title="CD Projekt RED">CD Projekt RED</a> 
                    featuring the witcher <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Geralt_of_Rivia" Target="_blank">Geralt of Rivia</a>
                    The game was originally scheduled for release in late 2014, then pushed back to 24 February 2015, and finally
                     released on 19 May 2015. During the first two weeks since release it had sold more than 4 million 
                     copies worldwide, more than doubling the total sales of its predecessor, <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_2:_Assassins_of_Kings"
                    target="_blank">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a>Unlike the previous games, The Witcher 3 is set in a multi-region open world, featuring over 100 hours 
                    of content. Several early articles mentioned that the developers planned to have an open world similar 
                    to that of Skyrim, but 20% larger. The developers were quick to point out that while there was much to 
                    appreciate in Bethesda's open world concept, they were also making an effort not to repeat what they perceived 
                    as the flaws in-game. As with earlier games, the consequences of Geralt's actions will impact how the narrative 
                    progresses. The game has been built using the new REDengine 3 and was designed with player feedback from fans of
                     previous Witcher games in mind.</section>
